# Marine Life Giphy

The Marine Life Giphy app in the Giftastic Unit is a dymanically created web page that populates with either pre-programed gif buttons,  or allows the user to create a new button with a marine animal of the user's choice.  

The buttons,  pre-programed or newly created, consist of a keyword, which is the query,  and a limit callback of 10 gifs.  

In addition,   every gif consists of an animated gif image and a still image.  User is able to click on the image and either pause it or animate it.
